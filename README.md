How Cotton Yarn is Produced
1.	Processes in Yarn Production:
o	Preparation (Opening/Loosening, Carding, Drawing & Roving).
o	Spinning (Spinning & Winding).
o	Finishing (Re-spooling/Texturizing).
2.	Cotton Process Steps:
o	Preparation:
	Opening and loosening cotton fibers.
	Carding aligns fibers into strands (slivers).
	Drawing & Roving blends fibers and adds slight twists.
o	Spinning:
	Converts slivers into long continuous threads.
	Wound onto spools (cheeses).
o	Finishing:
	Adds chemical treatments for yarn properties.

Filatoi Riuniti Background
•	Family-owned spinning mill in Piemonte, Italy.
•	Founded in the 19th century, began as a small-scale production in a barn.
•	Expanded significantly between 1880–1920.
•	Modernized equipment after WWI but faced post-WWII economic struggles.
•	Current focus: Cotton yarn production for high-quality fabrics.

Filatoi Riuniti's Current Challenges
•	Expansion Strategy (1980s–1990s):
o	Invested heavily in capacity to meet growing demand.
o	Early 1990s: Economic recession in Italy halted expansion.
•	Financial Problems:
o	Strengthened lira made exports less competitive.
o	Decrease in apparel demand and new competitors.
o	Italian labor laws made layoffs difficult without proving "financial distress."
•	Imbalance in Production:
o	Over-expanded preparation and finishing capacities.
o	Spinning capacity insufficient for demand.

Outsourcing Spinning Production
•	Outsourced part of spinning to six family-owned mills:
o	Suppliers: Ambrosi, Bresciani, Castri, De Blasi, Estensi, Giuliani.
•	Production Schedule (February):
o	Total demand: 104,500 kg.
o	Outsourced 32,000 kg of coarse yarn.
o	Costs varied per supplier and yarn size.
•	Current Outsourcing Costs:
o	Higher prices for spinning finer yarns.
o	Coarser yarn outsourced due to cost-effectiveness.

Consulting Intervention
•	Milan Consulting Group (MCG) hired to address financial challenges.
•	Key Focus Areas for Cost Reduction:
o	Reduce machine downtime.
o	Reschedule maintenance.
o	Optimize production shifts.
o	Improve outsourcing strategies.
________________________________________
Optimization Model
•	Decision Variables (Xij):
o	i: Yarn size (extra fine, fine, medium, coarse).
o	j: Suppliers (Ambrosi, Bresciani, etc.).
•	Objective: Minimize total costs while meeting demand.
•	Constraints:
o	Capacity limits at each supplier and Filatoi Riuniti.
o	Yarn demand by size.

Cost Details
•	Production Costs:
o	Cost/kg varies by supplier and yarn size.
•	Transportation Costs:
o	Fixed rate/kg/km multiplied by round-trip distance.
o	Example: Giuliani transportation cost = $0.50/kg.
Machine Hours
•	Machine hours required to produce each yarn size depend on equipment and yarn specifications.
•	Capacity differs across mills.
